# Advent of Code Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language. This repository contains my personal solutions, organized by year and day.

## Repository Structure

Each year of the Advent of Code has its own directory, named by the year (e.g., `2020`, `2021`). Within each year's directory, you'll find subdirectories for each day, labeled as `Day01`, `Day02`, etc. Each day's directory contains the solution files and a README with the problem description and my approach to solving it.

Example Structure:
```
/
├─ 2023/
│  ├─ Day01/
│  │  ├─ chal1.py
│  │  ├─ chal2.py
│  │  ├─ input.txt
│  │  └─ README.md
│  ├─ Day02/
│  └─ ...
├─ 2024/
└─ ...
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteveMcKeon/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Specific Challenge:**
   Replace `[year]` and `[day]` with the respective year and day you're interested in.
   ```bash
   cd [year]/Day[day]
   ```

3. **Read the Problem Statement:**
   Each day's directory has a README.md file with the problem statement.

4. **Run the Solution:**
   Run the solution file using the appropriate command for the language used. For example, if the solution is in Python:
   ```bash
   python chal1.py
   ```
